# Assumptions

*  Since there are no specifications, Java 8 is used because it remains the most dominant version of Java.

## The entity
*  The inverted is by default false.
*  The 'description' column type is BLOB, which has a maximum length of 65,535 bytes;
*  The 'expiresOn' can be only on  the future in case of creating/updating the entity;

## The API
*  Since the versioning approach was not specified, the URI Versioning was used for simplicity purposes.
*  The API uses LocalDateTime (UTC);
*  Super admins can delete features and relations;
